I really need to focus on prioritizing my workouts and my dissertation and making work get further down the list and that is very hard for me to do but it is important. One of the things that I want to remember to do the next time I'm asked about evaluation of this app is like the check-ins do not need to be about my movement like it's just most of them aren't even accurate and like why would they like why are you trying to guess where I am or what I'm doing like there's so many more productive check-ins like you know are you focusing on being nice are you um have you have you moved much today why don't you think about moving every hour how about doing 50 crunches this afternoon try to get a good night's sleep tonight I don't know just anything but like positive and wellness rather than just focused on random like I just I don't know random check-ins that don't make much sense that are very useful so I guess you know that I'm alive but that's about the only benefit from them I'm gonna try really hard to prioritize dissertation and exercise over the next actually week so there we go there's a goal today is Thursday night prioritizing exercise dissertation for a week test me on it thank you

155,"Well, I am definitely back on a good track with my dissertation, so that is making me pretty happy. Going to bed early, getting up early, and even fitting it in during the day. So I am going to stay on that track and even improve it, keep writing lists of goals and meeting them, setting goals, and I am working toward them. Because if I can keep up this pace, it feels like anything is possible. Otherwise, I don't know, my stomach hurts tonight, so we'll see what's going on there. But I did pass up an opportunity to go to lunch today and I kind of regret it. So there's that. I thought, well, it's going to be a busy day. I want to get a lot of work done and if I'm going to take a break, I want it to be a run. But of course, I didn't really run until the end of the day and even then, it was kind of a short run and I could have done that even if I had gone out to lunch. So it's kind of frustrating that I did that, but oh well, maybe I'll just make sure that I don't give up the chance to do it another time. So next time, I'll make sure I accept the invitation because I know that missing out on work is not that big of a deal. It doesn't make that much of a difference.

156,"Oh geez, three in a row now, huh? Today was super productive. I was busy from the time I woke up pretty much until like 5 p.m. and then I sort of melted into needing to rest a little bit and I haven't gotten as much done since 5 p.m. The last three hours have been hanging with my kids, playing a game, making them dinner, texting friends, hanging out in the hot tub for the second time today, just really taking it slow since 5 p.m. But from the first 12 hours of the day we're incredibly busy, like boom-da-boom-da-boom-da-boom thing, one thing to the next to the next to the next and super super productive. I'm just running out of steam, which is kind of common for me on weekdays anyway and seems to be happening today too, so I'm just gonna try to do the best I can to get through the night. I probably won't be very more productive, but I'm hoping that tomorrow I can kind of carry some of that productivity through the day. And good, good feelings. This is always good for me. I like being productive. It makes me very very happy, especially on a Saturday, maybe do a little more relaxing on a Sunday, but not too much. Oh, I want to make English muffins tomorrow. That's my goal. That's my relaxing goal, so see if I do that.

But I got up at 3.30 this morning. I got a lot of work done then. I also just was pretty focused on trying to get work done the rest of the day. So made some progress, a lot more progress left to go. A lot more to do this week. But I wanna keep focusing on exercise. Next might be food, because the more exercise, the more I eat. So it'd be nice to be a little healthier about those choices, so that my exercise is actually kind of complimented by my food. I'm not there yet. Maybe that's my next journey.

160,"I started the day with some solid exercise, a long walk, and a workout and then I was able to really focus on work for a good part of the day only having about two hours of meetings and that seems to be a very good balance for me. Actually it was probably like two and a half hours of meetings but that's a lot less than normal for me on a Tuesday. So I actually took a lunch break and did a few things that really needed to be done around home which felt great because there had been some leftover items from the weekend. That was helpful. I'm anxious to get back to have some solid time to get some projects done but I think I can do it tomorrow with some very serious focus because I actually don't have a lot scheduled tomorrow so I think I'll be able to pull off some coding and work on a presentation that I'm trying to finish. With those two things that'll be a good day. So setting goals for tomorrow early as I go to bed.

162,"One thing I think is really funny, and that's something that I can't stop thinking about, is how things end up being the way they should in the end, even though I worry a lot in the process. So, this happened to me many times about getting to grad school and now getting to the rotation lab. And it's so painful and annoying to worry and not know if things are going to work out. But in the end, we just don't know what is better for us. We imagine something should be fine, and then something went wrong. And because this thing went wrong, we end up going in a different path that originally won't go. And with that, we end up being exactly in the right place, in the perfect place, that if things hadn't gone wrong, we possibly wouldn't go. So, it's just so nice to, after having lived many experiences like that, to kind of start to develop some awareness that things will be fine, even if it's not in the way we were expecting it to be. And I hope that with some practice and considering all my experience, I will be able to know that things will be fine and not worry that much and trust in the process.

163,"So today was actually not the best day. I think I might go back and I would change that smiley face maybe to a little bit more of a flat face. I just felt like I, or a neutral face, I just felt like I had a lot of time today to work on what I wanted to and it didn't turn out that way at all. It was like, I feel some days like the day is stolen from me and that's what today felt like. I got a few things done, but really not much. And it was just very, very frustrating. So I'm not sure how to fix it. I feel like tomorrow I don't have as much time. So it's gonna be even harder to like actually get the things done that I wanna get done. So I'm just, the week's almost over and I don't have, I don't have my presentations done and I don't have any agreements done and that's what I needed to do. I also feel like that time that is after work and the kids come home from school from three to six is just so impossible. It's just run, run, run, run, run, run, run and nothing gets done and there's way too much to do in too little time. That is my least favorite part of the day. So if I could try to figure out what's going on there and how to make it better, that would be good.

But I won't be able to stop working until, like, tomorrow, so hopefully that'll be better. Um, today my mom and I went to Walmart, which was the first time I really drive my car in Boston, and it wasn't bad at all. We did get lost though, and she did get mad, but she calmed down, and apparently she was boasting about me, so that was kind of nice. Um, I also keep getting really bad headaches, um, which I think has to do with the working non-stop situation. So hopefully I can, like, go to sleep, basically.

166,"Today was okay. I think I had the feeling of getting some good conversations about my science in. I am slowly, slowly making progress on my dissertation. Forever frustrated that I don't give it more time. But you know, taking a break from it is probably not a bad thing. And I hope to do that. I have a few things I need to get done before Monday. So I'm just going to just try to do those few things before Monday. And then really focus in on it next week. Just keep, I think I need to move to weekly goals. Because I have monthly goals, but it's hard to keep your eye on a monthly goal. Whereas I think weekly goals, I can either meet them or push them to the next week. Every single week. And then eventually I'll even get to daily goals. But right now I think weekly goals are the right way to go about it. I have started my weightlifting routine since I have started journaling. So I am now lifting weights three times a week. And it's maybe not quite as much as I would like to be doing, but it is consistent. And I think I'm on my fourth time. So a week and a half-ish fifth time. So yeah, it's going well. And next week is going to be hard because I'm going to be traveling. But my goal is to keep up my weightlifting routine and to set a weekly goal for dissertation and meet that as well.

Sunday should also be a rest day, play outside. I'm very tired, more tired than I should be, but it's Friday, so going to bed early is not a bad thing. We will get up early.

And so I enjoyed the sunshine very, very much as it streamed through my windows. I ran the kids around a little bit here and there, but I mostly just decided I needed to not do anything. Rest day. I worked most of the day, got a few things done that I need to get done. I just sat on my computer, had some conversations, ate some decent food, and just enjoyed being home. Went outside a few times, but I didn't force myself to go for a walk. I didn't force myself to do anything. Just got done what needed to get done. And did a bunch of packing and preparing for the week and it felt great. So I just made sure to not feel guilty and my plan is to not feel guilty about it for the rest of the week. As my week goes forward, I want to just be happy with my choices because I'm traveling a lot this week and I feel like that's going to make it really hard to make sure that I get everything done that needs to get done.
