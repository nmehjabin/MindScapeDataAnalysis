Second, I find a lot of the prompts to not really reflect my day-to-day experience. This is because the app tends to see trends or differences in my behavior when there isn't a particular cause behind them. For example, I've gotten a few questions about why I think my texting or calling behavior has changed, and I can only reply that it's because of natural fluctuations. I didn't purposely change that behavior, and when viewed over a longer span of time the behavior isn't really changing. It's just in one day I happened to get a call from my mom and a friend, and the other day I didn't. Also, the location data isn't entirely accurate, so sometimes the app will think I'm in my dorm when really I'm in my house's kitchen, or that I'm in a friend's dorm when really I'm at the climbing gym. It's hard to resolve those issues for sure, but it ends up generating prompts that don't really apply to what my daily experience was.","There was one prompt that really resonated with me, and it was about changes to my walking routine. The app couldn't have recognized this, but I've recently started a meditative practice when I'm walking from class to class. About a week or two after I started it, I got a question from the app about my walking routine, and it gave me an opportunity to reflect on how the meditative practice had been going!","There have been a few times where, when I'm using my phone, I'll see the little green light that pops up on Android to let the user know that their phone's microphone is being used. Every time I see that little light, I'm prompted to think about whether my current device usage is reflecting what I want it to. There have been a few times where I'm scrolling through Instagram, I see that light pop up, and I decide to move on from the phone use and to the rest of my day.",N/A,"This may improve just with more usage, but having the app use data from a longer period of time would definitely help in producing more relevant prompts. Also, making the location data more specific might help as well. I'm not sure if this would be possible, but maybe having the app access a phone's usage history instead of just using the data it collects after it's installed? That might help limit the number of prompts that come about as a result of superficial or ephemeral trends.","Love the ease of use of the app. Super simple to click on the notification and complete the journaling and check in practices. Not a huge fan of the journal prompts, as I haven't found them to be entirely relevant to my personal experience. But I think that, as the app gathers more data about my daily habits, those are likely to improve. I think the idea of personally-tailored journaling prompts is an incredibly promising one!","Ability to see your responses to past journal questions, perhaps a summary of your phone's usage data, ability to create custom maps so the app can properly identify which location you're in (like maybe you can select and label specific regions on a google map for locations you frequently visit)","Love the idea so far, looking forward to seeing how it continues to progress!",25

",I liked the ones that encouraged me to plan ahead. What are you going to do this week to get more exercise? -- as an example. This made me think about it and set goals. ,"Not much change at all, but I do make sure I am journaling at the same time as I brush my teeth each night and this works well for me because it rides on the idea of matched routines or developing habits which I think would be very helpful for my life and well-being overall. ","The check-ins are not accurate enough to be useful at all. The check-ins seem to assume that whenever I am talking it's social, but I work and go to school and have kids so none of this is what I consider social and that's the majority of my time. I haven't made any changes and haven't been inspired to make changes other than the one I mentioned about a journaling time. The 8pm time coupled with teeth brushing has been nice and I would miss that. I almost think I could do just that part of the app every day if it was a reflection that I record each day. Perhaps something more targeting to recording process on a goal.","They are only ok, but I wonder if (as I just mentioned) they could be more of a prompt to reflect on goal progress rather than guesses about what I did that day. So, for instance, have us set some goals at the start of the session (or month) and then prompt us to record progress each evening and reflect on that progress or lack of progress. I believe that would be far more helpful to me. I also found the weekly assessments to be a complete bore and felt like  chore. But could those be a metric more related to my goals?  How did you sleep from 1 to 5? How much did you walk/run from 1 to 5? How much did you strength train? etc.","I like the evening journaling, I did not like the weekly assessments at all (absolutely the worst timing ever to come on a Sunday which is like a day off and usually a day to be out having fun not doing weird phone chores). I found the breathe in and out thing to be meh. I really didn't find any benefit to it. Same with the check-ins. Not hard but not helpful. ",Goal Setting!,"There were a few questions when I first got started. Like were the check-ins supposed to be accurate or just close enough?  Am I ""liking"" them or agreeing with them?  I'm still a little unsure of that. And sometimes submitting the journal is confusing. But I think I got the hang of all that fairly quickly.  ",6

One other critisism about the short tumbs up/down check ins: These were often structured in the following way: it seems like you did X today, did that make you feel Y? The thumbs up/down format is not able to to differentiate between a thumbs down because I did not actually do X, or because I did not feel Y.
