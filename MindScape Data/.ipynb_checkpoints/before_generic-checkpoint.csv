I've been pretty buried this week. I also go for walks and runs, and well, that's about all I do. Well, I was playing hockey a couple of times this week, and that's away from the screen, but mostly just work. Tomorrow, though, I'm going skiing, so that might be nice. I do some cleaning and chores around the house. I am looking to get into some hobbies for February break. My kids really could use some time with me doing something other than just getting ready for school and horsing around after school. It would be nice to actually do some sewing or I don't know what else. Maybe we could do some crafts and puzzles. We might be able to, yeah, figure out something to do together as a family with my mom. Have some Grammy time over break. I'm also hoping to just spend some time in the hot tub relaxing. That would be nice. Continue to run, walk. Oh, I would like to get back into lifting weights. That would be great if I could focus on that. I'm not quite sure how to get back into that because I just haven't had the time to make that happen, but maybe I can make that a goal over the next seven weeks and I can check in and let you know how it's going.

85,"Actually, I think a lot of the chatter that you heard was my talking on the phone on another phone that I have at work. So a lot of it was meetings, but I also got to take some of today off and go skiing with my husband. And so we got to chat a lot too. So that was another reason that there was a lot of chatter today. I always feel wonderful when I'm talking to people, and I do like to talk to them in person rather than text, but I always try to text people as well just to give them the heads up that I am around and that I want to be connected to them. So I usually send a few messages whenever I think about it. I like talking things through. I'm an external processor. I like to have people around me. I like to exercise and talk at the same time. And all of that really happened today. My kids also talk all the time. So if I'm around my kids, you'd probably pick up on that as well. But I'm guessing a lot of it was work. I did get to talk with my boss today, which was really nice. We've been putting it off for a couple of weeks now, and it needed to happen because I've been feeling like we need to make some major changes. And we finally got to talk about those changes. But honestly, I need some focused studying time, and I'm hoping to get it this weekend. Although I have the kids all weekend, so I'm not quite sure how that's going to work and how to balance if I get any free time if I should work or if I should try to play. No matter what, I should try to get some exercise, go for a run or something today. I think that would be nice to be able to run or to, well, play hockey would be great, but I don't think that's going to happen. Maybe ski, although I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get the kids out skiing today either. Probably not going to happen. Probably wait until the whole family's around and then we can ski together because that's just so much easier than trying to drag everybody out there and ski when it's just me and all the skis. But hopefully we'll find something fun to do and have some quality time together, and it'll be a good weekend. I'm looking forward to it.

89,"Taking Friday off both weeks is a huge advancement for me, really makes a big difference on how I end up feeling about the week, about myself, about the month and the year, about my life. So I'd like to continue to take either an afternoon or day off. The way that I'd like to improve is that if I could actually take the time off rather than just making it up by working overtime at all other times during the day and during the week. So I'd actually like to take that time so that I'm working less hours in the week rather than taking that time and working the same or even more hours in the week. Because that isn't a true break unless I'm actually resting every day and not just overworking myself in order to rest. But regardless, I think that resting is better than not resting, even if it means overworking. I think that's an improvement on my life. I also think that it would be nice to get into more of a routine with my physical exercise. I exercise a lot. I just went for a run for instance, but it's sporadic and it would be nice to, three days a week, wake up in the morning and go for a run. Two days a week, play capoeira. Two days a week, play hockey. Six days a week, go for a walk. That kind of thing. I think that's really what's gonna make a difference in my life. And then if I can also regulate what I'm eating along with the physical exercise, again adding more routine into my day, I think that's really what's gonna make the difference for feeling calm and in control of everything that's happening in my life.

I attended a lot more events and did a lot more with my time so yeah it was very enriching.

97,"Well, I did not run today, which is leaving me with a little bit of a issue with the fact that I need to do three runs to meet my goal this week. I don't know if that's going to happen because today was probably the best chance. I did lift my weight, so that's good, or did my three minute weight lifting, so that's good. And there's still time. It's early in the week, so I might still be able to do the run. My outgoing calls are up. That was yesterday. I caught up with my friend who I hadn't talked to in many months, and it was really nice to just talk about work and kids and marriage and life. So we needed a catch up, and I'd really like to do that more often. It's a lot for me to talk on the phone that long, and I didn't get much done other than just kind of laundry and some puttering, and I was ignoring the kids during that time. But it is nice to catch up with friends, because if that doesn't happen, then it feels like forever, and I don't get to talk to them. And years go by, and then it's kind of awkward to talk to somebody after years, although it's probably not. It just feels harder to overcome that first phone call after it's been so long. So yeah, I think that that's what you're talking about is yesterday. It seems like this app or this little bot thing might be a little bit behind or something. It's also so weird to assume that I have my phone on me at all times. It's like, oh, you sat today, and I was like, no, I went for a long run. I just didn't bring my phone with me on my run. Yeah, that's definitely a big assumption. Anyway, I am going to go to bed early tonight, and I think that will really help my day tomorrow.

I did do a few, well I did a longer walk this morning than I normally do and the new spot is that my neighbor has eggs so if I walk just a little further every that I do every morning then I can actually bring home a couple dozen eggs so that's pretty awesome. Then the other thing is I often walk to and from my office which I did today and then I took a couple of phone calls while walking so busy busy busy talk on the phone talk and move around kind of thing so that I can do walking meetings but overall today was absolutely terrible just so much stress but in the end it all seems to be working out but oh my goodness I got to figure out how to not be so stressed in the middle of the day because it's really more than I can handle. The walking does help but I didn't go for a run today but I am going tomorrow so I don't know if I'm gonna get my three in or not probably not but I'll keep trying.

So we were able to just sit down while she was sitting, I was buzzing around making dinner which was perfect, and just chat, it was really nice. I think it's good for me to reflect a little bit on the day and on where I am in my life and kind of catch up on what's going on in her life, what's going on in my life. It's really important to me, social time, friend time is very, very important to me. So I appreciate that opportunity.

So I absolutely think that's the new walk that I would like to try or the new route. I've often been walking downtown from campus, but walking to the north might be an even better option. I also just did a few, I had a very active day today. A few different, different walks through the buildings and through campus, which I would like to continue on the days that I'm on campus.

And I got so much done. It's that morning brain, which I have known for a while now, is what really works for me. Hyper productive time for me. And so maybe I can try that again tomorrow. Although I know I'll have the kids first thing in the morning. But I will give it a try because I really need to get stuff done. And that's helpful. I also tried a midday session. It was about 45 minutes today. And I did get something started, which was helpful, that I'd been wanting to get going on for a while. But it wasn't. Just middle of the day, my mind wandered. I wanted to do other things. Whereas first thing in the morning, I'm just ready to go. And I'm able to... My brain is working. I can write. I can do statistics. I can... Whatever it is needed, I can do it. So maybe I will keep that up this coming week.

I often go for a run. It's a five mile loop that I do, and I did that today. I also went to a friend's house, and I picked up some seeds that I had ordered. So those were all maybe new spots. I also play hockey, so I went to the hockey rink this weekend, and to the town dance, and then all around town at Winter Carnival. On Thursday, I absolutely went to some new spots that I had never been to on campus. So that could be part of it as well. But I bet you'll see these same spots popping up again, because I do run and play hockey and spend time around the town village as well. I do like going to new places. I'm going to a new place tomorrow with some friends to go skiing, and I also really like to go shopping, and I will be doing that in a couple of weeks' time, so you'll notice some new places as well.

Just got home from hockey, I am going to go relax in the hot tub. How can I possibly match today? Well, I can make sure that whenever I have holidays, I plan something fun like I did today, and not just stay home.

So I'm trying to think back to my day and what you may have interpreted as a walk. This morning I walked my kids to the school bus and that is just the end of my driveway and back which is which is probably a walk for several for many people. I did not continue on which I do most mornings in part because I wanted to get going and I was driving this morning somewhere so I wanted to get on the road but also in part because it was really cold this morning. Mostly because I wanted to get on the road so I think having a little bit more laid-back of a morning where I can just go to work is a little easier for me so I can do that walk in the morning. Otherwise I'm quite hungry I want to get eating so that I can continue on with my continue on with my day. I do want to get back to these morning walks though because they are very very nice for the rest of my day. Gets me exercise first thing.

So I think I need to put that first. Put that right in the schedule, or else it's not going to get done. So next week is going to be a vacation week, so it's going to look a little different. But I am planning on making sure that I meet fitness goals next week, first and foremost. And my conversations and my work goals are going to be secondary to any fitness goals. So first are the kids, second is fitness, third will be work on my dissertation, and last is going to come work next week, and that's just the way it has to be. That's why it's vacation, so that I can actually have a reorder of priorities, because every other day it's work first, and then there's hardly any time left over for anything else.

Less screen time though. Yes, it is my kids vacation and I am trying really hard to focus on them and making sure that I don't spend very much time on screen time. So the only screen time pretty much today was some messaging back and forth and also some research on places to go and things to do on vacation. So using the phone for kind of its functionality and not the functionality and not the sort of social or media kind of fun distracting apps. More just as a device to do research and also to communicate. I am trying really hard not to spend as much time. Hopefully I can read a book or something on vacation that will also help. And as far as fitness routine, I don't really have a routine, but I am trying to skate or play hockey or bike every day. So tomorrow's a run, Tuesday's a bike, today I skated.

That would be ideal, so that I don't just ask, what do you do, where do you live, do you ski, but instead I'm asking, like, what motivates you, what drives you, what's really meaningful to you and your life, and just go deep and get to know somebody really well. I also hate when I talk about money, so I'd like to talk about money less, but we went out to dinner last night, so there was a lot of chit chat there, and then of course I've been with my kids all day, so they talk and talk and talk and talk, and that's probably what this phone is picking up, or the microphone is picking up, is all of that chitter chatter.

140,"Sometimes it's really helpful to make a phone call because the phone call can actually be a check-in. You know that the person, if they respond, they'll respond right away. You can get more emotion in their voices, a sense of how they're actually feeling, what they're doing, and you can just have a more meaningful conversation than texting. But honestly, most of my calls have been work calls, so sorry to disappoint, but it seems like this AI tool thinks that anytime I use my phone or have a conversation, it's social. And no, I work most hours of the day, and oftentimes it's about work. So that is, makes most of the prompts or the little check-ins inaccurate, but I kind of ignore that part and just try to say, okay, yes, it's accurate, or no, it's not accurate based on the way that it talks about what I've, what they think I've been doing. So like, yes, I was on the computer a lot, but no, it wasn't social. It was work related. This seems to be working though. I seem to be getting most of these, so hopefully it's helpful.

150,"Yes, I started back up on my walks every day after I dropped the kids off and then to pick them up at the end of the day. And it's very helpful for me to just, as I mentioned before, tie my routine to something else. So I can choose whether or not to walk, but I can't choose whether or not to take, to walk the kids to the school bus stop. So this way I'm tying something optional to something mandatory. And that is very helpful to me because then I kind of make the optional mandatory and it's like harder to not walk than it is to walk. And tomorrow, actually, I'm going to add weights to the routine as well and try that twice a week. So it helps a lot, helps me keep moving. I also, I just kind of picked up my steps today. So I did a thing where I would work for the first 45 minutes of an hour and then try to not just walk, but like move for the last 15 minutes. So I would, I also like started making dinner, you know, I didn't take the compost out, but that would be an example, like something else, doing something else for that last 15 minutes. And because I didn't have a lot of meetings today, I was actually able to do that, I think every hour except one or two. So it worked out, I kind of lost it toward the end of the day, but at least the day started out pretty good. And I'd like to continue doing that on days that I don't have, that I don't have meetings or too many meetings. And then I'll have to come up with something new for days that I do have a lot of meetings, but I still only got about half the steps of a really good day. So when I was on an assignment in California this past summer, just about every day of three weeks, and I mean like really close to every day, I got 25,000 steps or 10 miles. And that's a big difference because today it was 12,700 or like five and a half miles. So it's not the same thing. It's about half that. So I know what I'm capable of.

So this prompt is a little hard to answer because I don't think it's accurate. But I did make a lot of calls today on my work phone, and that's because it's more culturally appropriate to talk on the phone about things, and it's kind of, you can resolve problems a little more easily that way. And I can also talk on the phone while I'm driving. So that's what I did today in both directions. I don't think I made very many phone calls other than just the ones that I made while I was driving. On days that I commute, that's what I do. So that's probably what was seen in this case. But I do like connecting on the phone because some friends just kind of glaze over things and you can get a little deeper into the conversation if you talk on the phone. You can hear people's emotions. You can ask questions and hear the answers right away and give each other good attention and have a full conversation, whereas texting can be a little bit more haphazard.
