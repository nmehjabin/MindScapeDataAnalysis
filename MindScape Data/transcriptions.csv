I could have done better in leaving behind my work, but overall it was nice to take a break. Tomorrow is also a break time, even more so because it's Saturday, and we can play, and we can rest. Sunday should also be a rest day, play outside. I'm very tired, more tired than I should be, but it's Friday, so going to bed early is not a bad thing. We will get up early. I don't want to have a lot of goals for the weekend. I just want to relax.

155.mp3,"So today I was pretty annoyed by having a meeting in the middle of my workout and I was reminded that my workouts really need to be more of a priority. I really need to focus on prioritizing my workouts and my dissertation and making work get further down the list and that is very hard for me to do but it is important. One of the things that I want to remember to do the next time I'm asked about evaluation of this app is like the check-ins do not need to be about my movement like it's just most of them aren't even accurate and like why would they like why are you trying to guess where I am or what I'm doing like there's so many more productive check-ins like you know are you focusing on being nice are you um have you have you moved much today why don't you think about moving every hour how about doing 50 crunches this afternoon try to get a good night's sleep tonight I don't know just anything but like positive and wellness rather than just focused on random like I just I don't know random check-ins that don't make much sense that are very useful so I guess you know that I'm alive but that's about the only benefit from them I'm gonna try really hard to prioritize dissertation and exercise over the next actually week so there we go there's a goal today is Thursday night prioritizing exercise dissertation for a week test me on it thank you
"
141.mp3,"Sometimes it's really helpful to make a phone call because the phone call can actually be a check-in. You know that the person, if they respond, they'll respond right away. You can get more emotion in their voices, a sense of how they're actually feeling, what they're doing, and you can just have a more meaningful conversation than texting. But honestly, most of my calls have been work calls, so sorry to disappoint, but it seems like this AI tool thinks that anytime I use my phone or have a conversation, it's social. And no, I work most hours of the day, and oftentimes it's about work. So that is, makes most of the prompts or the little check-ins inaccurate, but I kind of ignore that part and just try to say, okay, yes, it's accurate, or no, it's not accurate based on the way that it talks about what I've, what they think I've been doing. So like, yes, I was on the computer a lot, but no, it wasn't social. It was work related. This seems to be working though. I seem to be getting most of these, so hopefully it's helpful.
"
157.mp3,"Oh geez, three in a row now, huh? Today was super productive. I was busy from the time I woke up pretty much until like 5 p.m. and then I sort of melted into needing to rest a little bit and I haven't gotten as much done since 5 p.m. The last three hours have been hanging with my kids, playing a game, making them dinner, texting friends, hanging out in the hot tub for the second time today, just really taking it slow since 5 p.m. But from the first 12 hours of the day we're incredibly busy, like boom-da-boom-da-boom-da-boom thing, one thing to the next to the next to the next and super super productive. I'm just running out of steam, which is kind of common for me on weekdays anyway and seems to be happening today too, so I'm just gonna try to do the best I can to get through the night. I probably won't be very more productive, but I'm hoping that tomorrow I can kind of carry some of that productivity through the day. And good, good feelings. This is always good for me. I like being productive. It makes me very very happy, especially on a Saturday, maybe do a little more relaxing on a Sunday, but not too much. Oh, I want to make English muffins tomorrow. That's my goal. That's my relaxing goal, so see if I do that.
"
143.mp3,"Oh, I do have a new favorite route, so I've been walking from dropping the kids off to school to the end of the road and back, but now I have a friend who wants to join me, so I walk to her house, knock on her door, and see if she wants to come with me. And I think this might be a new routine. I did it this morning, and I would like to continue to keep trying it. It absolutely uplifts me. It gives me exercise first thing in the morning, and it also allows me to be in a place where I can enjoy social time in addition to the time with getting the exercise and the time with my children, because part of the walk is getting my kids to the bus. But it is all tied to the bus routine, so unfortunately when the bus doesn't run, I don't do it. So that's something that I need to think about.

95.mp3,"Last week I think I didn't take my phone along with me for the entire day for one day in the week and I ended up depending on other people for simple things as time etc but overall I think I remembered the engagements that I was supposed to visit in much more clarity than when I actually carry my phone. I attended a lot more events and did a lot more with my time so yeah it was very enriching. I think I was able to devote a lot of my time to talking to people instead of checking my phone to see where is the next place that I have to get to. It had its pros and its cons but yeah overall I think it was more enriching yeah

156.mp3,"Well, I am definitely back on a good track with my dissertation, so that is making me pretty happy. Going to bed early, getting up early, and even fitting it in during the day. So I am going to stay on that track and even improve it, keep writing lists of goals and meeting them, setting goals, and I am working toward them. Because if I can keep up this pace, it feels like anything is possible. Otherwise, I don't know, my stomach hurts tonight, so we'll see what's going on there. But I did pass up an opportunity to go to lunch today and I kind of regret it. So there's that. I thought, well, it's going to be a busy day. I want to get a lot of work done and if I'm going to take a break, I want it to be a run. But of course, I didn't really run until the end of the day and even then, it was kind of a short run and I could have done that even if I had gone out to lunch. So it's kind of frustrating that I did that, but oh well, maybe I'll just make sure that I don't give up the chance to do it another time. So next time, I'll make sure I accept the invitation because I know that missing out on work is not that big of a deal. It doesn't make that much of a difference.
"
90.mp3,"Taking Friday off both weeks is a huge advancement for me, really makes a big difference on how I end up feeling about the week, about myself, about the month and the year, about my life. So I'd like to continue to take either an afternoon or day off. The way that I'd like to improve is that if I could actually take the time off rather than just making it up by working overtime at all other times during the day and during the week. So I'd actually like to take that time so that I'm working less hours in the week rather than taking that time and working the same or even more hours in the week. Because that isn't a true break unless I'm actually resting every day and not just overworking myself in order to rest. But regardless, I think that resting is better than not resting, even if it means overworking. I think that's an improvement on my life. I also think that it would be nice to get into more of a routine with my physical exercise. I exercise a lot. I just went for a run for instance, but it's sporadic and it would be nice to, three days a week, wake up in the morning and go for a run. Two days a week, play capoeira. Two days a week, play hockey. Six days a week, go for a walk. That kind of thing. I think that's really what's gonna make a difference in my life. And then if I can also regulate what I'm eating along with the physical exercise, again adding more routine into my day, I think that's really what's gonna make the difference for feeling calm and in control of everything that's happening in my life.

84.mp3,"Well, I wouldn't say I've had less screen time, but maybe a little less time on my phone. I work most of the time, so it hasn't quite been hobbies or other activities, just mostly work. I've been pretty buried this week. I also go for walks and runs, and well, that's about all I do. Well, I was playing hockey a couple of times this week, and that's away from the screen, but mostly just work. Tomorrow, though, I'm going skiing, so that might be nice. I do some cleaning and chores around the house. I am looking to get into some hobbies for February break. My kids really could use some time with me doing something other than just getting ready for school and horsing around after school. It would be nice to actually do some sewing or I don't know what else. Maybe we could do some crafts and puzzles. We might be able to, yeah, figure out something to do together as a family with my mom. Have some Grammy time over break. I'm also hoping to just spend some time in the hot tub relaxing. That would be nice. Continue to run, walk. Oh, I would like to get back into lifting weights. That would be great if I could focus on that. I'm not quite sure how to get back into that because I just haven't had the time to make that happen, but maybe I can make that a goal over the next seven weeks and I can check in and let you know how it's going.

147.mp3,"Oh jeez, I don't know if I actually have any academic successes. I think one of them is I got a citation, which is actually a good thing, in case you didn't know, for a class because I was just filling out the form, but I was just giving feedback to every single person. It was just a little bit of extra effort and paying attention to the rules and doing what was asked. So I don't know if that, like in reflection, I don't think that's necessarily something that I can continue to do or expand upon. But maybe it does relate a little bit to this idea that, like, it doesn't take much. You got to just be consistent and do a little bit at a time. And that's actually my philosophy on my dissertation right now, which is that I am just plugging away at the process by making sure to do something every day. And I need to make sure I do that tomorrow, too, even though I'm probably going to feel like I'm too busy to do it. I think it's the consistency. So spending a half hour, an hour tomorrow on my dissertation is going to be my goal.
"
153.mp3,"I did make one call today, but I wouldn't say that I have been making many more calls than usual. I would actually say I've been texting more. So this prompt is a little hard to answer because I don't think it's accurate. But I did make a lot of calls today on my work phone, and that's because it's more culturally appropriate to talk on the phone about things, and it's kind of, you can resolve problems a little more easily that way. And I can also talk on the phone while I'm driving. So that's what I did today in both directions. I don't think I made very many phone calls other than just the ones that I made while I was driving. On days that I commute, that's what I do. So that's probably what was seen in this case. But I do like connecting on the phone because some friends just kind of glaze over things and you can get a little deeper into the conversation if you talk on the phone. You can hear people's emotions. You can ask questions and hear the answers right away and give each other good attention and have a full conversation, whereas texting can be a little bit more haphazard.

Thanks for the great idea and the motivation.

87.mp3,"Well, I already did a journal entry today, but maybe it didn't register or maybe I need to do one again. It was an awesome day. I got to go skiing with my husband and we also got some yummy tacos for dinner and I finally got to do a couple of things at work. I still have more to do though and I'm thinking I just need to work this weekend. So I'm going to bed early and I will get started early tomorrow and I will be able to get a little bit done. I don't know what else the weekend holds. I'm tired. Okay, I'm gonna try to get some exercise this weekend, lift weights, go for a run and get work done and spend time with the kids. If I can do all those things, then I think it'll be an excellent weekend.
"
93.mp3,"I kind of have mixed feelings about this because I've lately been pretty busy with my work and I have research deadlines that I need to meet. So I didn't have the luxury to have plenty of social interactions. But if I feel like I'll need one, I think I'll probably designate some time after class to talk with my friends in my cohort. So that would be one of the ways that I could increase social interaction.

I think there I don't remember or I think I didn't have any messages that brought joy on me I am anxious right now and I am fully focused for my exam tomorrow once I complete this exam I will be free for a while this was such an intense term
"
151.mp3,"Yes, I started back up on my walks every day after I dropped the kids off and then to pick them up at the end of the day. And it's very helpful for me to just, as I mentioned before, tie my routine to something else. So I can choose whether or not to walk, but I can't choose whether or not to take, to walk the kids to the school bus stop. So this way I'm tying something optional to something mandatory. And that is very helpful to me because then I kind of make the optional mandatory and it's like harder to not walk than it is to walk. And tomorrow, actually, I'm going to add weights to the routine as well and try that twice a week. So it helps a lot, helps me keep moving. I also, I just kind of picked up my steps today. So I did a thing where I would work for the first 45 minutes of an hour and then try to not just walk, but like move for the last 15 minutes. So I would, I also like started making dinner, you know, I didn't take the compost out, but that would be an example, like something else, doing something else for that last 15 minutes. And because I didn't have a lot of meetings today, I was actually able to do that, I think every hour except one or two. So it worked out, I kind of lost it toward the end of the day, but at least the day started out pretty good. And I'd like to continue doing that on days that I don't have, that I don't have meetings or too many meetings. And then I'll have to come up with something new for days that I do have a lot of meetings, but I still only got about half the steps of a really good day. So when I was on an assignment in California this past summer, just about every day of three weeks, and I mean like really close to every day, I got 25,000 steps or 10 miles. And that's a big difference because today it was 12,700 or like five and a half miles. So it's not the same thing. It's about half that. So I know what I'm capable of. It's just that I do, I do spend a lot of time at the computer when I'm working.

86.mp3,"Actually, I think a lot of the chatter that you heard was my talking on the phone on another phone that I have at work. So a lot of it was meetings, but I also got to take some of today off and go skiing with my husband. And so we got to chat a lot too. So that was another reason that there was a lot of chatter today. I always feel wonderful when I'm talking to people, and I do like to talk to them in person rather than text, but I always try to text people as well just to give them the heads up that I am around and that I want to be connected to them. So I usually send a few messages whenever I think about it. I like talking things through. I'm an external processor. I like to have people around me. I like to exercise and talk at the same time. And all of that really happened today. My kids also talk all the time. So if I'm around my kids, you'd probably pick up on that as well. But I'm guessing a lot of it was work. I did get to talk with my boss today, which was really nice. We've been putting it off for a couple of weeks now, and it needed to happen because I've been feeling like we need to make some major changes. And we finally got to talk about those changes. But honestly, I need some focused studying time, and I'm hoping to get it this weekend. Although I have the kids all weekend, so I'm not quite sure how that's going to work and how to balance if I get any free time if I should work or if I should try to play. No matter what, I should try to get some exercise, go for a run or something today. I think that would be nice to be able to run or to, well, play hockey would be great, but I don't think that's going to happen. Maybe ski, although I'm not sure I'm going to be able to get the kids out skiing today either. Probably not going to happen. Probably wait until the whole family's around and then we can ski together because that's just so much easier than trying to drag everybody out there and ski when it's just me and all the skis. But hopefully we'll find something fun to do and have some quality time together, and it'll be a good weekend. I'm looking forward to it.

It's also walking and running are not that intense for me, and so I also want to add in more intervals or periods of time when I am more intensely exercising with the cardio along with the strength training.

So I'm trying to think back to my day and what you may have interpreted as a walk. This morning I walked my kids to the school bus and that is just the end of my driveway and back which is which is probably a walk for several for many people. I did not continue on which I do most mornings in part because I wanted to get going and I was driving this morning somewhere so I wanted to get on the road but also in part because it was really cold this morning. Mostly because I wanted to get on the road so I think having a little bit more laid-back of a morning where I can just go to work is a little easier for me so I can do that walk in the morning. Otherwise I'm quite hungry I want to get eating so that I can continue on with my continue on with my day. I do want to get back to these morning walks though because they are very very nice for the rest of my day. Gets me exercise first thing.

134.mp3,"I don't think I'm actually texting less but sometimes if I'm able to talk and walk then it helps me very much and since I'm around the kids a lot this week I think that's probably why you're seeing a little less texting but not much I am trying to make a few phone calls here and there to catch up with folks and just have real conversations which help help kind of the dialogue back and forth so that we can actually make some decisions on things so that's part of what what we're seeing here so social wellness I think texting would be a little of texting a little bit more would be helpful for me because then I would be able to kind of stay up with people but it's pretty hard when I've got the kids all the time to actually be able to engage in text conversations so doing the best I can surviving this week and trying to provide some entertainment for the kids I'm going to try to go home a little early to get myself back in order I think that'll be helpful I think everybody would probably be more regulated if we're home for a little longer

120.mp3,"this prompt doesn't really make sense. I'm not gonna try calling a friend today and then share how it differed from texting, but I can try to answer. Let's see. I have been talking on the phone. I've just been talking on my other phone which is my work phone, but yeah I don't have time to talk on the phone. So yeah I'm not gonna call friends more. Texting just works really well for me, so I don't think that's gonna be something. I mean I when when there's days that it works, it works. So I will call my mom tomorrow because it's her birthday, but I'm calling a friend on a day like today is not a great idea because today I had meetings all day long. I still had some social, but Tuesdays generally aren't my social day. So yeah I just did some texting tonight and that works for me.

109.mp3,"Yes, absolutely. Today I walked north of campus because I had an errand to run and there's a path the entire way. You can walk really fast and not be, have to worry about traffic or be in the way of anybody. You can just walk. And I realized that there's the co-op right there, which would be a very nice way to treat myself to a visit to the grocery store. So I can walk north of campus, pop into the co-op and then walk back all within an hour. And that would be a wonderful, wonderful break someday. So I absolutely think that's the new walk that I would like to try or the new route. I've often been walking downtown from campus, but walking to the north might be an even better option. I also just did a few, I had a very active day today. A few different, different walks through the buildings and through campus, which I would like to continue on the days that I'm on campus.

121.mp3,"I definitely need the gym time for some time for refreshment from works and studies, but I really need to balance the time spent in the gym because I often spend too much time, like over two hours in the gym, that I get too exhausted, that I don't get that much worked on in the evening. So in the future, I'll need to get that balance right and do some chill exercises rather than spend too much time in the gym.

"
125.mp3,"I have been talking more on the phone lately, and I'm not sure why that is. It's nice. I think socially it helps me a lot. Most of them are work calls, although not all of them. But fitness-wise, I was thinking of that today because I was on the phone so much, I thought, mm, this is a time that I could have been running or working out, and I'm not. So I think I need to put that first. Put that right in the schedule, or else it's not going to get done. So next week is going to be a vacation week, so it's going to look a little different. But I am planning on making sure that I meet fitness goals next week, first and foremost. And my conversations and my work goals are going to be secondary to any fitness goals. So first are the kids, second is fitness, third will be work on my dissertation, and last is going to come work next week, and that's just the way it has to be. That's why it's vacation, so that I can actually have a reorder of priorities, because every other day it's work first, and then there's hardly any time left over for anything else. So I'm not going to start tonight, because I don't really like working out late at night at all, but first thing in the morning, I will plan something to do fitness wise.

So I have been, I met somebody new, and we got to chit chat a lot, and it's also vacation, so I can talk all day long if I want to, to friends, and I'm very extroverted. So I met somebody new, and I just wanted to get to know her, so I was asking about her house and her life and her kids and that sort of thing. I'd like to get to be even better at asking questions. I'd really like to set that as a goal, and be able to talk to people in a way that's very meaningful. That would be ideal, so that I don't just ask, what do you do, where do you live, do you ski, but instead I'm asking, like, what motivates you, what drives you, what's really meaningful to you and your life, and just go deep and get to know somebody really well. I also hate when I talk about money, so I'd like to talk about money less, but we went out to dinner last night, so there was a lot of chit chat there, and then of course I've been with my kids all day, so they talk and talk and talk and talk, and that's probably what this phone is picking up, or the microphone is picking up, is all of that chitter chatter. And it will probably continue for a couple of days until I go back to my solitary world of work and being at the computer and typing away at the computer all day.

133.mp3,"Oh yes, that's because my kids are on vacation, so I get lots of face-to-face time, way more than normal, and I'm enjoying it, but it is hard to get good studying done. So I've been struggling a little bit, doing it more in the morning and in the evening. Studying time is definitely better, but I'm just settling in for hopefully an hour tonight of at least getting something done. It's mostly just been little pieces here and there instead of like focused time, but tomorrow's another morning. Every day I keep hoping I can make it work, and I keep trying. And you know, part of it is trying to rest too, so I sometimes wonder if I should stop trying to fit in work, and then I'll be more productive when I go back to it next week. But it seems like it's best to at least try to get little pockets in here and there. We'll see.
"
127.mp3,"Okay, strange. This is the message that I heard yesterday, I think, or Friday. I think it was Friday, but I don't think I made any phone calls today at all. So no, not more calls. Less screen time though. Yes, it is my kids vacation and I am trying really hard to focus on them and making sure that I don't spend very much time on screen time. So the only screen time pretty much today was some messaging back and forth and also some research on places to go and things to do on vacation. So using the phone for kind of its functionality and not the functionality and not the sort of social or media kind of fun distracting apps. More just as a device to do research and also to communicate. I am trying really hard not to spend as much time. Hopefully I can read a book or something on vacation that will also help. And as far as fitness routine, I don't really have a routine, but I am trying to skate or play hockey or bike every day. So tomorrow's a run, Tuesday's a bike, today I skated. We will see how Wednesday, Thursday, Friday go, but that's the plan to stay fit during vacation.

Just got home from hockey, I am going to go relax in the hot tub. How can I possibly match today? Well, I can make sure that whenever I have holidays, I plan something fun like I did today, and not just stay home. And I know that the rest of the week, I can try to sprinkle in some adventures here and there, but I also know that I need to be home a lot this week, and that's okay. I can do that. I have to buckle down and get work done, because I took today off. Hooray for federal holidays!

115.mp3,"Yes, it's the weekend, so I have gone to lots of new places. Let's see. They actually aren't new for me, just haven't been since I've been journaling with you all. So let's see. I often go for a run. It's a five mile loop that I do, and I did that today. I also went to a friend's house, and I picked up some seeds that I had ordered. So those were all maybe new spots. I also play hockey, so I went to the hockey rink this weekend, and to the town dance, and then all around town at Winter Carnival. On Thursday, I absolutely went to some new spots that I had never been to on campus. So that could be part of it as well. But I bet you'll see these same spots popping up again, because I do run and play hockey and spend time around the town village as well. I do like going to new places. I'm going to a new place tomorrow with some friends to go skiing, and I also really like to go shopping, and I will be doing that in a couple of weeks' time, so you'll notice some new places as well. It helps me to get out of the house. I'm also doing quite a bit of studying tonight, so that's good. I'll try to get my three runs in this week.
"
101.mp3,"I wasn't really more on the move today. I did do a few, well I did a longer walk this morning than I normally do and the new spot is that my neighbor has eggs so if I walk just a little further every that I do every morning then I can actually bring home a couple dozen eggs so that's pretty awesome. Then the other thing is I often walk to and from my office which I did today and then I took a couple of phone calls while walking so busy busy busy talk on the phone talk and move around kind of thing so that I can do walking meetings but overall today was absolutely terrible just so much stress but in the end it all seems to be working out but oh my goodness I got to figure out how to not be so stressed in the middle of the day because it's really more than I can handle. The walking does help but I didn't go for a run today but I am going tomorrow so I don't know if I'm gonna get my three in or not probably not but I'll keep trying. I'm two for two on the on the three minute weight lifting though. I'll keep working on it.

So, we are definitely pulling out some fun adventures for vacation. So, that's what inspired me. Um I'm also inspired to continue to visit these places with friends or just to do it again. Uh cross-country skiing is absolutely awesome this time of year and it's nice to have some real winter to enjoy. So, tomorrow will be a little cold starting out but I think it'll be end up being a really nice day. So, I'm looking forward to the adventures.

"
139.mp3,"Yes, I completely agree. Some of that is that I was using a calculator today, and so I had my screen open for the calculator, but I bet if I were to look at just the amount of time on social media, it would probably be more than normal. I think that's just today, although I'd have to look overall, and I'm not sure what happened today, to be honest. I definitely balanced it with work, so I was probably using the social media as a counter for the stress that I was feeling in all that I had to do for work. That's my guess as to why my digital screen time was so high today. I also did not do very much exercise today, so I would like to make sure that tomorrow I start back in exercising, eating right, and not being on the screen so much. That's the goal.

112.mp3,"Ah, great question. This morning was an amazing work time. I was able to just get up, go straight to my office, straight to my computer, and work for two hours. Not even two hours. And I got so much done. It's that morning brain, which I have known for a while now, is what really works for me. Hyper productive time for me. And so maybe I can try that again tomorrow. Although I know I'll have the kids first thing in the morning. But I will give it a try because I really need to get stuff done. And that's helpful. I also tried a midday session. It was about 45 minutes today. And I did get something started, which was helpful, that I'd been wanting to get going on for a while. But it wasn't. Just middle of the day, my mind wandered. I wanted to do other things. Whereas first thing in the morning, I'm just ready to go. And I'm able to... My brain is working. I can write. I can do statistics. I can... Whatever it is needed, I can do it. So maybe I will keep that up this coming week.

106.mp3,"Wow, you definitely noticed that I actually took an hour out of my day to hang out with a friend and it was in person and it was quite lovely. So we were able to just sit down while she was sitting, I was buzzing around making dinner which was perfect, and just chat, it was really nice. I think it's good for me to reflect a little bit on the day and on where I am in my life and kind of catch up on what's going on in her life, what's going on in my life. It's really important to me, social time, friend time is very, very important to me. So I appreciate that opportunity. Otherwise my day was fairly stressful and maybe taking that hour out is what makes it even more stressful but I feel like I need it and if I didn't do that I'd be doing something else. So I had planned to run but it was so blustery today that I didn't run, I ended up just having tea with a friend instead. But I'm going to do my three minutes so that I'll at least have that and my three minute workout and I did play hockey tonight as well which of course I don't have my phone on me so that doesn't get picked up but that is my happy place and I'm playing again tomorrow night as well. Tomorrow is going to be a very different day and I will probably be walking a lot.
"
161.mp3,"I started the day with some solid exercise, a long walk, and a workout and then I was able to really focus on work for a good part of the day only having about two hours of meetings and that seems to be a very good balance for me. Actually it was probably like two and a half hours of meetings but that's a lot less than normal for me on a Tuesday. So I actually took a lunch break and did a few things that really needed to be done around home which felt great because there had been some leftover items from the weekend. That was helpful. I'm anxious to get back to have some solid time to get some projects done but I think I can do it tomorrow with some very serious focus because I actually don't have a lot scheduled tomorrow so I think I'll be able to pull off some coding and work on a presentation that I'm trying to finish. With those two things that'll be a good day. So setting goals for tomorrow early as I go to bed.

149.mp3,"Home is actually a good place for me to be, especially on a weekend, so I get to spend time with my family, and I also can have friends over, which I love to do. So today I had many friends over, and I did leave home. I went for a ski, and then I went to Capoeira, so I enjoy being out and about, but I do appreciate just having that foundation that kind of keeps me happy, keeps me feeling like I'm somewhat in control, that I'm grounded, that I have everything sort of sorted out. When I'm away from home, it feels just a little... I'm okay with it, but it feels a little more ungrounded, like I'm always missing something or that there's always something that I should be doing. It's just very easy to work, relax, do anything I want to do, cook. It can all happen when I'm home, and I appreciate that very much.

163.mp3,"One thing I think is really funny, and that's something that I can't stop thinking about, is how things end up being the way they should in the end, even though I worry a lot in the process. So, this happened to me many times about getting to grad school and now getting to the rotation lab. And it's so painful and annoying to worry and not know if things are going to work out. But in the end, we just don't know what is better for us. We imagine something should be fine, and then something went wrong. And because this thing went wrong, we end up going in a different path that originally won't go. And with that, we end up being exactly in the right place, in the perfect place, that if things hadn't gone wrong, we possibly wouldn't go. So, it's just so nice to, after having lived many experiences like that, to kind of start to develop some awareness that things will be fine, even if it's not in the way we were expecting it to be. And I hope that with some practice and considering all my experience, I will be able to know that things will be fine and not worry that much and trust in the process.

So I'm just going to just try to do those few things before Monday. And then really focus in on it next week. Just keep, I think I need to move to weekly goals. Because I have monthly goals, but it's hard to keep your eye on a monthly goal. Whereas I think weekly goals, I can either meet them or push them to the next week. Every single week. And then eventually I'll even get to daily goals. But right now I think weekly goals are the right way to go about it. I have started my weightlifting routine since I have started journaling. So I am now lifting weights three times a week. And it's maybe not quite as much as I would like to be doing, but it is consistent. And I think I'm on my fourth time. So a week and a half-ish fifth time. So yeah, it's going well. And next week is going to be hard because I'm going to be traveling.

98.mp3,"Well, I did not run today, which is leaving me with a little bit of a issue with the fact that I need to do three runs to meet my goal this week. I don't know if that's going to happen because today was probably the best chance. I did lift my weight, so that's good, or did my three minute weight lifting, so that's good. And there's still time. It's early in the week, so I might still be able to do the run. My outgoing calls are up. That was yesterday. I caught up with my friend who I hadn't talked to in many months, and it was really nice to just talk about work and kids and marriage and life. So we needed a catch up, and I'd really like to do that more often. It's a lot for me to talk on the phone that long, and I didn't get much done other than just kind of laundry and some puttering, and I was ignoring the kids during that time. But it is nice to catch up with friends, because if that doesn't happen, then it feels like forever, and I don't get to talk to them. And years go by, and then it's kind of awkward to talk to somebody after years, although it's probably not. It just feels harder to overcome that first phone call after it's been so long. So yeah, I think that that's what you're talking about is yesterday. It seems like this app or this little bot thing might be a little bit behind or something. It's also so weird to assume that I have my phone on me at all times. It's like, oh, you sat today, and I was like, no, I went for a long run. I just didn't bring my phone with me on my run. Yeah, that's definitely a big assumption. Anyway, I am going to go to bed early tonight, and I think that will really help my day tomorrow.

172.mp3,"Today was a really interesting day. My mood kind of shifted halfway through yesterday and I just needed to stay home and get work done today. And so I enjoyed the sunshine very, very much as it streamed through my windows. I ran the kids around a little bit here and there, but I mostly just decided I needed to not do anything. Rest day. I worked most of the day, got a few things done that I need to get done. I just sat on my computer, had some conversations, ate some decent food, and just enjoyed being home. Went outside a few times, but I didn't force myself to go for a walk. I didn't force myself to do anything. Just got done what needed to get done. And did a bunch of packing and preparing for the week and it felt great. So I just made sure to not feel guilty and my plan is to not feel guilty about it for the rest of the week. As my week goes forward, I want to just be happy with my choices because I'm traveling a lot this week and I feel like that's going to make it really hard to make sure that I get everything done that needs to get done.
"
158.mp3,"I wonder if this is wrapping up now that I have I'm not getting prompts but that's okay so let's see I had a fairly good day I was just as active as I was yesterday somewhat surprisingly went for a walk and a run and capoeira so that's good I got some work done although I didn't have as good of luck today with my dissertation work as I did yesterday but that's okay I also got a lot of cleaning done today which felt good so didn't necessarily do too much that was but had success in getting stuff done that really needed to be done I didn't really finish much but I got I made a lot of progress in several directions so not just millimeters of progress but good good cleaning progress that needed needed it pretty badly but there's of course so much more cleaning that needs to be done too so starting a new week I have been doing great on writing code but I really need to get back to working on my presentations because that's just gonna stress me out if I don't get those done so the next several days are just going to be focused on that and keeping running and working out at the same time
"
164.mp3,"So today was actually not the best day. I think I might go back and I would change that smiley face maybe to a little bit more of a flat face. I just felt like I, or a neutral face, I just felt like I had a lot of time today to work on what I wanted to and it didn't turn out that way at all. It was like, I feel some days like the day is stolen from me and that's what today felt like. I got a few things done, but really not much. And it was just very, very frustrating. So I'm not sure how to fix it. I feel like tomorrow I don't have as much time. So it's gonna be even harder to like actually get the things done that I wanna get done. So I'm just, the week's almost over and I don't have, I don't have my presentations done and I don't have any agreements done and that's what I needed to do. I also feel like that time that is after work and the kids come home from school from three to six is just so impossible. It's just run, run, run, run, run, run, run and nothing gets done and there's way too much to do in too little time. That is my least favorite part of the day. So if I could try to figure out what's going on there and how to make it better, that would be good.
"
170.mp3,"Well, today went okay all in all. It was definitely a family day. I just had nothing left at the end of it. I'm just so tired. And so here it is eight o'clock and I am done. I was done hours ago. So it's too bad that I just sometimes don't have a lot of energy on days like this, but it was fun and we got it done, but fun days should not feel like, oh, I got them done. It's just so exhausting, but I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow and I can actually do more things cause I have, you know, laundry and work and it would be nice to just be home, just getting things, like actually getting things done.

165.mp3,"Um, I've been pretty burned out since the end of the term and a little bit before. I work non-stop. Um, I really like a break though, um, yeah, because I'm really burned out. But I won't be able to stop working until, like, tomorrow, so hopefully that'll be better. Um, today my mom and I went to Walmart, which was the first time I really drive my car in Boston, and it wasn't bad at all. We did get lost though, and she did get mad, but she calmed down, and apparently she was boasting about me, so that was kind of nice. Um, I also keep getting really bad headaches, um, which I think has to do with the working non-stop situation. So hopefully I can, like, go to sleep, basically.
"
159.mp3,"Well, I somehow managed to get a lot done today. Even though I took time to go for a run, I took time to take the kids to the gym, and I'm not doing any work in the evening. But I got up at 3.30 this morning. I got a lot of work done then. I also just was pretty focused on trying to get work done the rest of the day. So made some progress, a lot more progress left to go. A lot more to do this week. But I wanna keep focusing on exercise. Next might be food, because the more exercise, the more I eat. So it'd be nice to be a little healthier about those choices, so that my exercise is actually kind of complimented by my food. I'm not there yet. Maybe that's my next journey.
